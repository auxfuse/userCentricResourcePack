---
## What does it do and what does it need to fulfil?
A website built to nurture the beginnings of a students Research skills. This is not a
definitive list, rather a starting point of the Resources, Tools and Useful Info for a student
to sink their teeth into when they need it and to develop an understanding as to the wealth of
knowledge that surrounds them.

Links and information provided to each individual facet of info to direct the student in the right
direction. The project was built using the Bootstrap Framework as it is what they will be using
and learning from in the run up to their first Milestone project as well as during.

## User Stories:
As a student, I want to learn how to research topics effectively.
As a developer, I want all my resources, frequently used tools & information all in one place for ease of access.


### User Acceptance Criteria:
* The website allows users to navigate to the preferred resource, tool or info at the click of a button.
* The website can be forked/cloned via Github for other developers to utilise and populate with their own repository of resources, tools & information.


## Technologies Used.
* HTML ~ main Language used to structure the individual pages of the website.
* CSS ~ styling language used to format and visually build upon the accompanying HTML.
* <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"> Bootstrap Framework</a> ~ Used as the core structuring layout building blocks of the website, ensuring mobile-frist design and responsive size display.
* <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm IDE</a> ~ PyCharm was used as the preferred IDE for this project.
* PyCharm built-in Terminal ~ Used to commit to local repository and further push to Github Repo ensuring version controlling of the project build.
* <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> ~ Installed on local device and integrated to PyCharm as a Plugin to enable version controlling.
* <a href="https://github.com/auxfuse/Milestone1">Github</a> ~ Used to host the deployed website and repository of all previous versions of the build.
* Google Chrome Developer Tools ~ Used as the core test phase throughout the project build life, testing the responsiveness of elements and CSS visuals.
* <a href="http://eye-dropper.kepi.cz/">Eye Dropper (Color Picker)</a> ~ Open Source Google Chrome Extension used to obtain hexadecimal/rgba/hsl values of colours. Built by Kepi (<a href="https://github.com/kepi">Kepi's Github</a>)
* Some <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#js">Imported Javascript & JQuery</a> ~ For the Modal and Responsive Navbar expand & collapse functionality.
* Pen & Paper ~ Used for the Creation of Wireframes.

### Deployment.
Website was created in PyCharm IDE. PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment developed by JetBrains.
Through PyCharm a local Git Repository was used, as was Github to ensure Version Controlling of the website was present from
the inception through to finalisation and deployment.

Cloning & Details:

In order to clone the website:
* Select the Repository from the Github Dashboard.
* Click on the <i>"Clone or download"</i> green button located above and to the right of the File Structure table.
* Click on the <i>"clipboard icon"</i> to the right of the Git URL to copy the web URL of the Clone. 

* Open your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and navigate to the terminal window.
* Change the directory to where you want to clone the repository too. (In the case of PyCharm the directory path can be found through the <i>"Navigate"</i> tab).
* Paste the Git URL copied from above and click <i>"Ok"</i>. (Again in the case of PyCharm once you click <i>"clone"</i>, Git Root mapping will be automatically set to the project Root directory). 


In order to deploy the website to Github pages, I:
* Selected the Repository from the Github Dashboard.
* Navigated to <i>"Settings"</i> and to the <i>"Github Pages"</i> Section.
* From the <i>"Source"</i> section, clicked on the dropdown and selected "Master Branch" from the associated List.
* Once <i>"Master Branch"</i> was selected, the page auto-refreshed, with a ribbon display detailing <i>"Github Pages source saved"</i> indicating the success of the deployment.
* The link to the website was found under the <i>"Github Pages"</i> section, with a ribbon notification stating:<br> __"Your site is published at <a href="https://auxfuse.github.io/userCentricResourcePack/</a>"__
