                    Software Development Resource Pack! Like many of you, I am relatively new to
                    the world of digital innovation, and through my time on Slack have come across
                    some very useful Resources, Tools & Additional supports that have helped me in
                    my journey to date.<br>
                    My name is Anthony and as recently appointed student lead for User Centric Frontend Development, I
                    decided to create a "webspace" dedicated to these supplementary solutions available
                    to me, and now to you!</p>

                    <p class="additional-text">A hot topic right now is "What Editor can we use?". Recently Code Institute students had to migrate from Cloud9, (an online
                    IDE), to AWS-Cloud9, (Cloud9 assumed by Amazon services). With this migration, it brought a host of new issues, learning curves and new questions such as the one above.
                    For the record, although it is recommended that students use the AWS-C9 IDE, it is important to note that this is not mandatory.<br>
                    Even before the migration, I myself opted to use an editor called PyCharm, which was recommended to me by my mentor. I followed along to the course material adjusting as needed, and have
                    been using it ever since, (my entire Milestone 1 was coded in PyCharm).<br>
                    Below you will find a short list detailing some of the IDE's I've seen people talk about using in the Slack App:</p>
