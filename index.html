                    <p class="additional-text">A hot topic right now is "What Editor can we use?". Recently Code Institute students had to migrate from Cloud9,
                                               (an online IDE), to AWS-Cloud9, (Cloud9 assumed by Amazon services). With this migration, it brought a host of new issues, learning curves and new questions such as the one above.
                                               For the record, although it is recommended that students use the AWS-C9 IDE,
                                               it is important to note that this is not mandatory.<br>
                                               Even before the migration, I myself opted to use an editor called PyCharm, which was recommended to me by my mentor.
                                               I followed along to the course material adjusting as needed, and have been using it ever since,
                                               (my entire Milestone 1 was coded in PyCharm).<br>
                                               Below you will find a short list detailing some of the IDE's I've seen people talk about using in the Slack App:</p>
